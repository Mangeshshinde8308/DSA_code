        //The List ADT need to store the required data in the sequence and should have the following operations:
        //get(): Return an element from the list at any given position.
        //insert(): Insert an element at any position in the list.
         //remove(): Remove the first occurrence of any element from a non-empty list.



        //Stack ADT, the order of insertion and deletion should be according to the FILO or LIFO Principle.
        // Elements are inserted and removed from the same end, called the top of the stack. It should also support the following operations:
        //push(): Insert an element at one end of the stack called the top.
        //pop(): Remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if it is not empty.
